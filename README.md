# HealthSystem â€“ Unity Observer Pattern

A Unity project demonstrating the **Observer Pattern** for a decoupled, event-driven Health System.  
Implements a `Health` subject that notifies multiple observers (UI, Audio, Logger) and includes a **GameOver system** as a bonus feature.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Observer Pattern** implemented using C# events (`Action<T>`) and typed event arguments.
- **Observers included:**
  - **UI_Observer** â†’ Displays health as text (TextMeshPro)
  - **Audio_Observer** â†’ Plays damage, heal, and death sounds
  - **Log_Observer** â†’ Logs health changes to the Console
  - **GameOver_Observer** â†’ *(Bonus)* Shows a Game Over image with fade effect and disables player control
- **Dynamic Subscribe/Unsubscribe** using `+=` and `-=` in `OnEnable`/`OnDisable`
- Clean, modular code with separation of concerns
- Simple demo scene for testing

## âš™ Requirements

- **Unity Version:** 2022.3.51f1 (LTS) or later  

---

## â–¶ How to Test

1. Open the project in Unity 2022.3+.
2. Load the scene: `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity`.
3. Press **Play**.
4. **Damage Test**:
   - Collide the `Player` with the `Hazard` object.
   - Observe health text update, damage sound, and console log.
5. **Heal Test**:
   - Pick up the `Medicine` object.
   - Observe health increase, heal sound, and console log.
6. **Game Over Test**:
   - Reduce health to `0`.
   - Game Over image fades in.
   - Player control is disabled.
   - Death sound plays.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Notes

- `Health.cs`:
  - Tracks `currentHealth` and `maxHealth`.
  - Raises:
    - `HealthChanged` â†’ Passes a `HealthEventArgs` struct `{ current, max, delta }`
    - `Death` â†’ Triggers Game Over
- Observers:
  - Subscribe to events in `OnEnable`
  - Unsubscribe in `OnDisable`
- Game Over flow:
  - Fades in a UI Image
  - Disables player controller component
